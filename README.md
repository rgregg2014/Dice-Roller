# DiceHub

## Description

This project is intended to be an all-in-one page for my TTRPG table to access tools not widely or conveniently available. The landing page is a basic dice roller run on the page with vanilla JavaScript. Further resources include other front-end generators, like a one-shot campaign generator and an insult generator. Other features will include a session scheduler and a note-taker for session plot and events.
